**Issue:** Why am I not seeing a link in Navi-X that was there before?

**Explanation:** There are several reasons a link would be in Navi-X and then disappear from a list.

1. The file is no longer available online because it was taken down for copyright infringement. There is nothing you can do to fix this issue. The content was taken offline for violating copyright law.

2. The file server hosting the file is offline for maintenance or is experiencing a network outage. You can wait for later and see if the link comes back on Navi-X or look for the file on another video source.

3. The person who added the link to either the file host in question or Navi-X has chosen to delete the link from availability. If someone removes the link from their file host or Navi-X, there is nothing you can do to get this back. Check another video source and see if they are also hosting the same file.
