**Issue:** Why did my video stream stop completely while playing?

**Explanation:** There are several reasons a video would stop in the middle of playing.

1. The file host you are streaming from is being over used and does not have adequate bandwidth at this time to transfer the file to you continuously. **Try another streaming source site/scraper or try the current file host later when they are less busy.**

2. You were somehow disconnected from your internet connection, which caused the stream to drop. **Make sure you have a solid wireless connection or use a wired connection. If you are using DSL or a network cable 30 feet or longer, make sure there is no static on the line or your carpet if the cable lays on one as well as the phone line connecting your modem to the phone jack. You can use "Static Guard" spray to remove static interference from your lines and surfaces if you have static electricity build up issues in your home.**

3. The file host is having a network or power outage. **There is nothing you can do about a network or power outage. Try another streaming source site/scraper or try the current file host later when they are less busy.**
