Issue:  How do I clear saved search terms in Navi-X?

Explanation:  If you open Navi-X, you can press the secondary menu button on your remote to bring up additional options in Navi-X. You can also hit the secondary menu button between the right Alt and right Ctrl keys on your keyboard.

Select Clear History, then click on Clear Searches to clear the saved search terms from Navi-X. You can also manually delete the search.dat file from within the Navi-X directory to clear the list as well.
