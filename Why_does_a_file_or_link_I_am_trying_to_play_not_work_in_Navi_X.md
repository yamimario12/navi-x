**Issue:** Why does a file or link I am trying to play not work in Navi-X?

**Explanation:** There are many reasons for a file to not play in Navi-X.

1. The file type may not be supported by your media center.
2. The file does not exist on the video host's server anymore.
3. The file is not available due to bandwidth restraints.
4. The file being hosted is corrupted or encoded improperly.
5. The file was added with the wrong "type" to a playlist.
6. The video host's servers being accessed may have an outage currently.
7. The "processor" script that resolves the final URL of a media item normally may be broken. Broken processors can be reported here: http://www.navixtreme.com/forums/?action=topic_view&id=270

To Fix This Issue:

1. If the file type is not supported by your media center, you may request for the media center developers to support the file format you are attempting to playback on their media center application.

You can check here to see if your device supports your preferred file formats:

XBMC

Boxee

2. If the file does not exist on the video host's server anymore, there is nothing you can do about this. Move on to another source and try again.

3. If the file is not available due to bandwidth restraints, there is nothing you can do about this. Move on to another source and try again.

4. If the file being hosted is corrupted or encoded improperly, there is nothing you can do about this. Move on to another source and try again.

5. If the file was added with the wrong "type" to a playlist, the user who added the link can check their playlists and change this to the correct type. If you are linking directly to a media file (example: http://www.whatever.com/nameofvideofile.avi... or .flv or .mkv), then make sure you choose "video" in type for video links and "audio" for audio links.

6. If the video host's servers being accessed may have an outage, all you can do is wait for the website in question to come back online and try again at that time.

7. If the "processor" script that plays back the item may be broken, this will typically be indicated by view-ability of items in a playlist, but nothing in the playlist actually plays. You can report broken "scrapers" or "processors" here:  http://www.navixtreme.com/forums/?action=topic_view&id=270
