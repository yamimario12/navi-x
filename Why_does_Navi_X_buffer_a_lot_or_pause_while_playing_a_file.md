**Issue:** Why does Navi-X buffer a lot or pause while playing a file?

**Explanation:** Navi-X is actually not buffering, the website you are streaming from is buffering your connection typically. This is due to lack of resources or high usage times and little available bandwidth for a particular website streaming content. You can either try coming back at a less busy time or try a different source in Navi-X for less buffering.
