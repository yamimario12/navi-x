**Issue:** How can I donate time, money or supplies to Navi-X?

**Explanation:** Team Navi-X and it's users cannot accept monetary donations of any kind for use or viewing of content in Navi-X! Asking for monetary donations of any kind if prohibited under our terms of service agreement, located at http://www.navixtreme.com and is punishable up to and including removal of content, temporary suspension of account privileges or permanent deletion of your Navi-X account.

However... donating your time or supplies to keep Navi-X alive is greatly appreciated. If you really want to help Navi-X, the best way to help is to collect links to multimedia content on the internet and add it to Navi-X via http://www.navixtreme.com. For advanced users, if you have the ability to code web scripts that can scrape site contents or resolving url media files directly to a player for playback, you can aggregate content into Navi-X automatically yourself, using web scripts. If you create a scraper or processor for Navi-X, please let us know at http://www.navixtreme.com/forums so we can add these to primary viewing sections in Navi-X. Additional documentation for coding for the NIPL API are available here: http://www.navixtreme.com/proc_docs/  &  http://www.navixtreme.com/proc_test/
We have also been known to accept generous donations of equipment and free hosting, without "quid pro quo" demands or contingencies.

If you are willing to do any of the above for Navi-X, we greatly welcome and champion this with anybody willing to work with us on aggregating content, stabilizing the system, coding contributions, collecting and re-posting of links or even projects and promotions.

Navi-X is free of charge, free to distribute, as well as free for programmers to modify and use snippets of code from the application in their own works. We simply ask if you choose to use a snippet of code from the Navi-X code base, that you attribute the works of code to the original developer and creator of Navi-X, Rodejo.

**NOTE:** If you wish to contribute to Navi-X, BUT insist on some sort of "quid pro quo", guarantee of service, monetary reparations either directly or indirectly or ask for anything in return for your contributions, PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER TO CONTRIBUTE TO NAVI-X!!

The fact is that Navi-X is an open source project and not a company or business and as such, does not allow for contractual obligations or considerations of any kind at this time. It has been deemed by the original creator of Navi-X that the application should permanently remain an open source project as in it's entirety. As such, we have chosen to respect the rights and wishes of it's creator and the users by making Navi-X forever an open source project. Please do not harass, intimidate or threaten our staff, members and users of Navi-X or appropriate actions may be taken to defend such assets. It is also a violation of U.S. federal law under the Computer Abuse and Fraud Act of 1984 to threaten or harass someone via the internet in an attempt to extort goods or services. If such an attempt is made on one of our staff or users, we reserve the right to prosecute an alleged aggressor to the fullest extent in a court of law, as allowed.
