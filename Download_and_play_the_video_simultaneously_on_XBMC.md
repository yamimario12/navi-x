**Issue:** Download and play the video simultaneously on XBMC.

**Explanation:** Since XBMC Eden it is possible to download and play the video at the same time.
Of course the download must have a steady speed.
Why? Because of this >>> http://code.google.com/p/navi-x/wiki/When_I_stream_a_movie_from_Navi_X_it_always_buffers_or_pauses
Navi-X got also an option to check download speed before downloading the file.
Since the video could cut off while downloading.

1. Make sure the download path is visible on XBMC
