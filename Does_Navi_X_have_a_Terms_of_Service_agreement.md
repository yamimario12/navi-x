**Issue:** Does Navi-X have a Terms of Service agreement?

**Explanation:** Yes. The terms of service for Navi-X can be found here: http://www.navixtreme.com/terms/

**If at anytime, you do not agree with the terms of service for Navi-X, please discontinue usage of Navi-X immediately!**

If you were charged money for Navi-X by anyone, you will want to get your money back as Navi-X is an open-source, free program for distribution and developmental use and we do not charge our users for Navi-X ever.
