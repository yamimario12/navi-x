**Issue:** Does Navi-X host the files and content found in Navi-X?

**Explanation:** No. Navi-X only links to content on the internet, either by publically available channels or user-submitted links to content on the internet. We never host any multimedia content, thus content would not be available if a particular website was down or no longer serving such content from their website.

If you ever experience buffering issues from links located within Navi-X, it is typically due to the lack of system resources available for the file server streaming you media, not your internet connection, router, modem or setup... usually. Please try another source located within Navi-X for your file.
