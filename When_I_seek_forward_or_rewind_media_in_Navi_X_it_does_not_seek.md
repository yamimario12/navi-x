**Issue:**  When I seek forward or rewind media in Navi-X it does not seek.

**Explanation:**  Navi-X does not control seeking of media, the media center you are using controls this. If this feature is not working for you there are 2 possibilities of what is causing the issue:

**1.** The media you are playing does not have keyframes encoded into the file. Keyframes are markers for the media player to reference for quick seeking within a media file. When a file is not encoded with keyframes, you are unable to seek a file properly. Technically it is the media center's duty to resolve this issue for the specific file format, but may or may not get resolved upon submitting the issue to support. It is at there discretion.

**2.** The file server dropped connectivity or streaming of the media file. This happens for many reasons but particularly when a website is overloaded or has little bandwidth to serve you the file. Even slight overloading of the file servers can cause this to happen and there is nothing you can do about this.
