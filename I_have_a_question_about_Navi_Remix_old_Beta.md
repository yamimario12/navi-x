**Issue:** I have a question about Navi-X Remix (old Beta).

**Explanation:** No technical support is being offered for this port of Navi-X any further at this time. If your question is technical in nature, please know the application has been shelved from current developments and no developer or technical support is available at this time. If the project should find a new developer and technical support representative, then technical inquiries for the software can be made at that time.

**Please use the software as is in it's current condition. If something fails to work, Team Navi-X will not resolve issues for the app.**

**If you have a general question about how to use something within the app, iRoNBiLL will still address those questions at** http://www.navixtreme.com/forums
