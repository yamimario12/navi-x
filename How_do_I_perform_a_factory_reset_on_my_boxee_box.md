**Issue:** How do I perform a factory reset on my boxee box?

**Explanation:**
Sometimes, the update for firmware on a Boxee Box does flash your device properly during an update over the internet directly. The symptoms typically include primary features not working in Boxee or Navi-X. If you feel your device should be completing a task that appears to be failing or not working, you should consider factory restoring your boxee box and manually updating your firmware from a flash drive. Instructions to manually update from a flash drive will be included in a separate article via search.

**To Fix This Issue:**
1. Turn off the Boxee Box with the power switch on the top of the box.
2. Press and hold the power button for more than 5 but less than 8 seconds.
3. The Boxee Box will restart with gray screen and take a longer time to load.
4. Eventually the green Boxee logo on the box will turn orange/yellow.
Then a menu will pop up with options. Select "Factory Restore" and confirm to start the process.
