**Issue:**  Is Navi-X or XBMC a "hacking" tool?

**Explanation:**  No. Navi-X is an app, integrated with a user database with links to media content and a series of hosted scrapers and processors. More information on what these are can be found on our home page when you create a free account on Navi-Xtreme. These scrapers and processors, pull in website content into a list then resolve the URL's for media directly to a media center's player. No hacking is required to aggregate publicly accessible data from a website.

XBMC is a media center, that plays back content located on a local hard disk or from internet protocols. If media is introduced to the player directly and it is a supported file format, the player will play the media.
