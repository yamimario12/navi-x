**Issue:** What is a "scraper"?

**Explanation:** A scraper is a web hosted script that reaches a website and "scrapes" the relevent multimedia from a web sites pages and builds a playlist with this multimedia for browsing a sites multimedia content.

A scraper can be written in many "web language's" such as PHP, Perl and ASP and then the script is hosted on a web server so when it is given a call, it retrieves the current sites multimedia and builds it into a compatible Navi-X playlist.

If you are not familiar with "web languages" then this exercise is not for you. If you are familiar with web languages, you can read more about this among tech sites where "website scraping" is discussed. You will have to learn how to make a web site scraper on your own as it applies to everything web related, not just Navi-X.
