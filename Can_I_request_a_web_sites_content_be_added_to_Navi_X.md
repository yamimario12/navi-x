**Issue:** Can I request a web sites content be added to Navi-X?

**Explanation:** Yes. You may request that a web sites content be added to Navi-X here:
http://www.navixtreme.com/forums/?action=topic_view&id=76

**Note:** Requests and creation of new scrapers and processors for a website are done so on an entirely voluntary basis by Navi-X developers and community of users. No one is "assigned" to the task of bringing in new content and even then, sometimes it is not possible due to technical complications imposed by the site or media center in question.

If you make a request for content, please be very patient as our request list is several miles long and is backlogged always do to the amount of requests we receive to aggregate such content. Thanks for your patience with your request.

To request web sites to be added to Navi-X, you have to have a free Navi-Xtreme account to post about it in the forum thread link above.
