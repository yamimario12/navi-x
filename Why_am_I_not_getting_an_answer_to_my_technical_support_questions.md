**Issue:** Why am I not getting an answer to my technical support questions?

**Explanation:** Navi-X is an open-source project entirely reliant on the contributory works of individuals who dedicate their time to making Navi-X better and full of more content.

As such, all individuals are not mandated or obligated to tend to the project whatsoever.

Currently, we have 1 dedicated developer and CEO, 1 Project Coordinator and Lead Technician and a handful of individuals who offer their incredible time and skills to the cause of Navi-X.

These people have their own lives and schedules. Please be patient with us as we attempt to respond and resolve each and every request sent to us. Thanks.
