**Issue:** How do I report a technical error for Navi-X?

**Explanation:** You may go to http://www.navixtreme.com and either use the Shoutbox by leaving a message, then coming back later to check for a response or you can use our forums and open a new thread and let us know what you need help with.

**When reporting a technical eror, please include the following information in your communication:**

1. What version of Navi-X are you using?
2. What is the make and version of your media center?
3. What operating system are you running Navi-X on?
4. A detailed description of what your concern or technical trouble is, as well as where you can find it in Navi-X. (example: In Navi-X > Navi-X Networks > Music > MTV Music Videos.)

Please make sure you offer as many details about the issue as possible. Giving us a short and incomplete answer is unacceptable and will delay your technical resolution time.
