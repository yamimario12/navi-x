Issue: Is Navi-X a company or on the stock market?

Explanation: No. Navi-X, Team Navi-X or it's members and affiliates are not a company, apart of a company or have stock of any kind.

We are a team of freelance individuals who come and go throughout the project, contributing code, artwork, creative projects and essential services to the Navi-X project in each members own time frame, for no pay or expectation of monetary gain.

While your interest is appreciated in seeing Navi-X or Team Navi-X becoming a publicly traded company, we have no interest in doing this and have decided to make Navi-X an "open-source" application, free for everyone to use and distribute, as long as Navi-X exists.
