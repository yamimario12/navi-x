**Issue:** Where can I find Navi-X Beta for Boxee?

**Explanation:** Navi-X Beta for Boxee has been renamed to Navi-X Remix, as the app has been shelved by Team Navi-X for future developments. It was originally developed by a programmer known as Bartsidee. He is no longer actively developing the application and since we do not have a dedicated developer for active work on the version that was slated to be version 4.0 of Navi-X, the app has been shelved and will remain in the Navi-X repository until it becomes non-functional or a developer picks up the app.

To Fix This Issue: You can add the new Navi-X Remix repository by adding this address in your Boxee software under Apps > Repositories.
