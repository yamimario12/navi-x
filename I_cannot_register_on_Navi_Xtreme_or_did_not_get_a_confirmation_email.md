**Issue:** I cannot register on Navi-Xtreme or did not receive a confirmation e-mail.

**Explanation:** The reason this happens is when people try to register a new playlist hosting account with a full "temporary internet files" folder, there is no space in the folder for Navi-Xtreme to cache the web pages form request, thus when you click send, you will get the message asking you to confirm your account via e-mail, but the request was never actually sent to our database to process.

Don't laugh or get angry about this because it's a quick and easy fix. The only time this problem would occur outside of full "temporary internet files" is because our website is down or not working properly. If you tried the remedy below and are still not getting the request, then please e-mail us for assistance at xironbillx@gmail.com. Please make sure you have tried this solution as well because even if we did manually edit the database from our end just for you, it still wouldn't load and work on your end because of the "temporary internet files" being full. Believe it.

**How To Delete Temporary Internet Files From A Computer**
In Windows, if you go to "Start button", then "Control Panel", then "Internet Options"... where it says "Browsing History", click on "Delete" and make sure put a check mark next to "Temporary Internet Files" and click on "Delete".

These instructions are just for Internet Explorer, so if you use another default browser, normally you will find a "Preferences" section or "Tools" or an "Options" section... this is where you will find the button for deleting temporary internet files.

Restart your browser after this then try to register again at NaviXtreme.com and you should get the confirmation e-mail you were expecting. Let us know if this does not resolve you problem please so we can investigate this. Thanks!
