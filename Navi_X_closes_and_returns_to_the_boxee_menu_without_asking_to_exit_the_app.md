**Issue:** Navi-X closes and returns to the boxee menu without asking to exit the app.

**Explanation:** At this time, there is currently no exit dialog function available in the Boxee API for python applications like Navi-X. When Team Boxee implements one, we will enable the feature. Until then, when you press the back key on your remote or keyboard and back up all the way to the main menu for Navi-X, when you press back, the app will automatically close and you will be returned to the Boxee menu.
