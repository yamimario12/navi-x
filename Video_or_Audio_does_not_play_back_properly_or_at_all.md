**Issue:** Video or Audio does not play back properly or at all.


**Explanation:**
A video or audio file does not play back properly or at all when attempting to play something in Navi-X.

Navi-X is not a media center or media player, it is an addon for media centers. The media center would either be XBMC or Boxee typically when using Navi-X.

If a file does not playback at all, you should get an error message explaining why it did not playback while in Navi-X. This error can be searched for in our database and given an explanation.

If the file does not playback properly or plays back distorted, with noises, too fast or slow, without video or audio or at the right resolution or encoding, the problem is with the media center's player in question. It is recommended you either file a bug request with the support site for your media center or wait for your media center developers to address playback issues with common files during their regularly schedule maintenance updates.
