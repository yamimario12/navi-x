**Issue:** How do I install Navi-X?

**Explanation:**

**On XBMC:**

1. Go to "http://code.google.com/p/navi-x/downloads/list" and click on the latest version of Navi-X to download the zip file.

2. Install XBMC on your computer or device if you have not already. You can get the latest "stable" and "unstable" builds at http://xbmc.org/download/

3. Once XBMC is installed open it and click on System > Addons > Install from Zip file. Select the location on your computer where you saved Navi-X and select the zip file.

4. Exit to the main screen of XBMC and check out "Programs"... Navi-X should be installed there. Make sure you always use the latest version of Navi-X and the latest "stable" version of XBMC, located in the primary download page for XBMC.

To update Navi-X, simply grab the latest copy on our website for XBMC.

**On Boxee:**
The app for this platform has been discontinued. Anything else found outside of this is an unsupported version of the app or reminents of the old port that have been modded to make it work, in which case you need to find out who's supporting these ports still and get support from them on these topics. Thanks!

**On Apple TV, iPad, iPhone and iOS supported devices:**

1. Jailbreak your Apple TV (or iOS device) and install XBMC. You can get details on how to do this from Google.

2. Once your Apple TV is jailbroken and has XBMC on it, you need to SSH and upload Navi-X to your iOS device in a folder that can be accessed by XBMC's file explorer. Here is a video detailing how to SSH into your Apple TV (iOS device) and upload files to your device. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x_pyFy1cI0

Alternatively, you could get an app from Cydia like "iFile" and download the zip directly to your device instead of ssh/ftp'ing.
3. Once the Navi-X.zip file is uploaded to your iOS device, open XBMC on your iOS device and go to System > Addons > Install from Zip file. Browse to the location on your device you uploaded the Navi-X.zip file to and select it to install Navi-X.

4. Exit to the main screen of XBMC and check out "Programs"... Navi-X should be installed there. Make sure you always use the latest version of Navi-X and the latest "stable" version of XBMC, located in the primary download page for XBMC.
