**Issue:** How do I manually update the boxee software from a flash drive?

**Explanation:**
Sometimes, the update for firmware on a Boxee Box does NOT flash your device properly during an update over the internet directly. The symptoms typically include primary features not working in Boxee or Navi-X. If you feel your device should be completing a task that appears to be failing or not working, you should consider factory restoring your boxee box and manually updating your firmware from a flash drive. Instructions to perform a factory reset will be included in a separate article via search.

**To Fix This Issue:**
1. Download the latest Boxee Box firmware at http://www.boxee.tv/download/boxeebox. The downloaded file will be named boxee.iso, and that name must be maintained.
2. Copy the boxee.iso file to a USB flash drive. Make sure to properly eject the flash drive after copying the file.
3. Power down the Boxee Box, then connect the flash drive.
4. Power up the Boxee Box by pressing and holding the power button for 6-10 seconds. Upon release, the box will boot with the logo turned yellow.
5. After the Recovery Menu appears, select Upgrade from USB from the menu and follow the on-screen instructions.
