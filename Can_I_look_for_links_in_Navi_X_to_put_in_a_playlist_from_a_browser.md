**Issue:** Can I look for links in Navi-X to put in a playlist from a browser?

**Explanation:** Yes.

Login to Navi-Xtreme at http://www.navixtreme.com and click "Home" at the top left corner of the Navi-Xtreme website and below the shoutbox is the "Navi-X Simulator". You can open it and do searches in it for whatever. Once the list of stuff comes up, right click on the simulator window and click "View original source"... you can then copy the whole playlist in text and paste it to notepad, then go through and grab links from it and paste them into your playlists under "My Playlists". It's best to have 2 windows open for this site... 1 for My Playlists and another for the Sim so you can just hit back on it and initiate another search.
